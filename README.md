# High-Throughput-Analysis of Spinacia oleracea Genome
This repository contains the scripts and data used for analyzing the Spinacia oleracea genome. The SP75 Genome data was obtained from the SpinachBase, and the analysis was performed using the latest version of the bioinformatics software tools.

## Prerequisites
The following tools were used for this analysis:

* HISAT2 for genome alignment
* FeatureCounts for gene expression quantification
* MultiQC for quality control and report generation

## Data
The raw fastq files were first trimmed using Trimmomatic and the resulting files were then used for alignment and quantification.

## Scripts

## Credits
This analysis was performed by Anne-Sophie Chys and Ruben Olbrechts as a part of a project of High Throughput analysis at the university of applied sciences Howest.
